# UlincsysMaster
This library provides a host of utility methods and data structures with varying functionality. This is just a passion project, and is not intended for professional or commercial use. I make no guarantees about the functionality or reliability of this code.
## A Note on Security and Performance
This project makes **heavy** use of combined reflection and generics, which has many implications. Reflection can have a significant performance impact depending on the situation, and can possibly expose the application it's used in to certain security vulnerabilities. I advise that you use this library at your own risk.

_More documentation may be coming soon, depending_
